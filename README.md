# SensiVitalisMLModel With MIMIC-III Database

## Project Description
This machine learning model aims to identify hidden features relating to a patient's temperature in the ICU before they experienced septic shock, using data from the MIMIC-III Clinical Database.

## Database Information
The MIMIC-III Clinical Database is a large, freely accessible critical care database that includes a wide range of anonymized data from patients admitted to critical care units. Access to the database is controlled and requires individual credentials.

### Data Use and Confidentiality
Access to the MIMIC-III Database is granted under strict conditions aimed at protecting patient and institutional confidentiality. Users must:
- Complete a training course in human subject research and data privacy.
- Sign the PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data Use Agreement, promising not to attempt to identify individuals or institutions, safeguarding the data from unauthorized access, and committing to use the data exclusively for lawful scientific research.

### Using Data from This Project
While this repository provides a machine learning model developed using the MIMIC-III dataset, it does not contain any of the data itself. Interested parties must obtain access to the MIMIC-III data directly through [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/).
